# js_applications_oct_2022

If you are reviewing the code - please skip the initial homework exercises - the main focus there was to get introduced to AJAX - no architecture used :)

No templating as well.

Homeworks and exam preparation for the course JS Applications October 2022 in Software University Bulgaria. The course is FRONT END and is focused on:

1. HHTP and REST services
2. Asynchronous Programming
3. Introduction of single page applications architecture with routing and modules
4. Introduction of templates

The format of the exam is a very simple Single Page Application with the following functionalies that need to be developped:

1. Login/Register/Logout - on success servers provides token authentication as well as other needed user data stored in session storage for later usage.

2. Dashboard page - collection of members. For each member of the collection - part of the information is rendered by the browser with possibilty to access more details by clicking on the respective button. In one of the sample projects I implemented pagination.

3. Details - a dedicated view for the details of the specific member chosen by the user. The view contains additional functionality - for example - like functionality, comments functionality, search functionality. It is very easy to combine and add functionalities to the details view.


I used Lit-html stand alone library for tempalting and Page library for routing. Playwright is used for e2e testing. Please note that e2e testing as well as html and css skeletons and the backend were provided by Softuni.

In exam preparations I use
